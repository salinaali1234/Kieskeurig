Today we discussed our user stories en started to assemble them.
We divided the tasks between us. I have the task of doing the municipality en the vote station.
We have also discussed that we have a deadline for the wireframe/prototype design. 
This wednesday is the deadline for the wireframe/prototype.

We have made a wireframe that is colour blind friendly. 
The website was designed according to the WCAG guidelines as much as possible.
This Monday we got our feedback for both the wireframe, user stories and UML class diagram. 

The feedback of the UML diagram:
In the UML, the info of the person who voted was not clear.
The candidates initials were not known. They didn't have initial ect.
The info on the UML did not line up with the XML file. Make sure they line up.
The candidate didn't have a role. 
As feed back we should look at the XML files more.

The wireframe feedback:
The wireframe should support mobile devices. 
Because our target audience are young adults, they will use their phones a lot.
So mobile responsiveness is a must.

The user story feedback:
For the feedback of the user stories is that we didn't have a lot of user stories. 
We need to make more for next week.

We have used the feedback to improve the wireframe, user stories and UML. 
Next week we will be having a product review on a Tuesday due to there being an event this Thursday. 
Monday is where we will be showing the UML for feedback.

This week we showed our UML, wireframe and user stories to the product owner. 
We also had a retrospective. We wrote an individual retrospective and a team retrospective.
We got our feedback over the UML, wireframe and user stories. 
 
User story feedback:
User story should be written step by step.
There should be a user story with an info page where you can see the campaign plan of the parties.
Add a top 5 of the most voted party.
There should be a filter where you can sort the candidate list per party.
There should be a filter option.
There should be a login and register function/user story.
There should be a function to post and react to posts.
There should be an admin function/ user story.
There should be a requirement that when a chart loads it should only take 3 seconds.

UML feedback:
Look at generics more.
Don't add functions in a UML
There is no need for a national candidate.
There is no need for a map.

Design/wireframe feedback:
Make the user stories on the basis of the design.
Make a discussion page in the wireframe.
