Today we discussed our user stories en started to assemble them.
We divided the tasks between us. I have the task of doing the municipality en the vote station.
We have also discussed that we have a deadline for the wireframe/prototype design. 
This wednesday is the deadline for the wireframe/prototype.

We have made a wireframe that is colour blind friendly. 
The website was designed according to the WCAG guidelines as much as possible.
This Monday we got our feedback for both the wireframe, user stories and UML class diagram. 

The feedback of the UML diagram:
In the UML, the info of the person who voted was not clear.
The candidates initials were not known. They didn't have initial ect.
The info on the UML did not line up with the XML file. Make sure they line up.
The candidate didn't have a role. 
As feed back we should look at the XML files more.

The wireframe feedback:
The wireframe should support mobile devices. 
Because our target audience are young adults, they will use their phones a lot.
So mobile responsiveness is a must.

The user story feedback:
For the feedback of the user stories is that we didn't have a lot of user stories. 
We need to make more for next week.

We have used the feedback to improve the wireframe, user stories and UML. 
Next week we will be having a product review on a Tuesday due to there being an event this Thursday. 
Monday is where we will be showing the UML for feedback.
